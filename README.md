This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

### Step 0: Install Dependencies

Before starting Metro or building the app, make sure you install all the required JavaScript dependencies:

```sh
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```sh
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app ‚Äî you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Testing your app

This app uses Jest and @testing-library/react-native.

```
npm test

# OR

yarn test
```

## Step 4: Modify your app

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's make changes!

Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and make some changes. When you save, your app will automatically update and reflect these changes ‚Äî¬†this is powered by [Fast Refresh](https://reactnative.dev/docs/fast-refresh).

When you want to forcefully reload, for example to reset the state of your app, you can perform a full reload:

- **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Dev Menu**, accessed via <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ‚åò</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (macOS).
- **iOS**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> in iOS Simulator.

## Architectural Decisions

### 1. State Management - Redux Toolkit
- **Why:** Provides predictable state management with excellent DevTools
- **Benefits:** Time-travel debugging, centralized state, excellent TypeScript support
- **Alternative considered:** Context API (chosen Redux for complex state management needs)

### 2. Folder Structure - Feature-based
- **Why:** Scales well as the app grows, clear separation of concerns
- **Benefits:** Easy to locate files, reusable components, maintainable codebase
- **Pattern:** Each feature has its own folder with components, styles, and logic

### 3. Styling - Styled Components Pattern
- **Why:** Theme support, component-scoped styles, TypeScript integration
- **Benefits:** Dynamic theming, reusable styles, better organization
- **Alternative:** StyleSheet (chosen styled approach for better maintainability)

### 4. API Layer - Service Pattern
- **Why:** Centralized API logic, easier testing, better error handling
- **Benefits:** Reusable across components, consistent error handling, interceptors
- **Implementation:** Axios with interceptors for common functionality

### 5. Custom Hooks - Logic Separation
- **Why:** Reusable logic, easier testing, cleaner components
- **Benefits:** Single responsibility principle, easier unit testing
- **Examples:** useWeather, useTheme, useStorage

### 6. Testing Strategy - Comprehensive Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** Components, hooks, services, utilities
- **Integration Tests:** Redux slices, API integration
- **Coverage Goal:** >70% for production readiness

### 7. TypeScript - Full Type Safety
- **Why:** Catch errors at compile time, better IDE support, documentation
- **Benefits:** Reduced runtime errors, better refactoring, self-documenting code
- **Implementation:** Strict TypeScript configuration with comprehensive typing

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **Memoization:** React.memo for components, useMemo/useCallback for expensive operations
- **Lazy Loading:** Dynamic imports for non-critical components
- **Image Optimization:** Proper sizing and caching for weather icons
- **API Optimization:** Request debouncing, error retry logic, timeout handling
- **Storage Optimization:** Efficient AsyncStorage usage with error handling

### üîê Security Considerations
- **API Key Protection:** Environment variables, never commit to repository
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- **Error Handling:** Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Network Security:** HTTPS only, proper timeout configurations

## üéâ Congratulations!
You're running a production-ready, scalable, and secure React Native Weather App. ‚ú®
